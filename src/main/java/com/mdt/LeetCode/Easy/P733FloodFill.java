 * An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.
 * <p>
 * You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the
 * pixel image[sr][sc].
 * <p>
 * To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel
 * of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the
 * same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.
 * <p>
 * Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
